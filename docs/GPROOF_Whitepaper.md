# GPROOF Whitepaper

## Introduction

**GPROOF** represents a new frontier in decentralized computing and trustless task validation using GPU-powered proof-of-work mechanisms. Unlike traditional mining systems, GPROOF rewards nodes based on **task performance**, **node reputation**, and **automated token distribution**. It combines transparency, reputation scoring, and tokenized incentives to build an ecosystem of reliable contributors to Web3.

## Core Philosophy

- **Efficiency**: Harnessing the parallel power of GPUs to solve tasks instead of wasting energy on meaningless hashes.
- **Reputation-Based Rewards**: Incentivizing good behavior and reliability through a trust layer backed by on-chain metrics.
- **Decentralization**: No single point of control. Tasks and rewards are distributed transparently.
- **Quantum-Aware Design**: Positioned to evolve alongside emerging quantum technologies in computational proof systems.

## Main Components

1. **GPROOF Token (GPRF)**
   - ERC-20 utility token.
   - Automatically distributed as a reward for valid task submissions.
   - Can be staked or exchanged for USDT/ETH.

2. **GPROOF Core Smart Contract**
   - Manages GPU task submission and validation.
   - Tracks and updates node reputation.
   - Calls the RewardManager for incentive distribution.

3. **TaskManager Contract**
   - Handles task creation, assignment, and submission logic.
   - Supports task complexity grading and performance checks.

4. **RewardManager**
   - Mints GPRF tokens based on rules triggered by GPROOF Core.
   - Can integrate future reward tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Quantum).

5. **Staking and Exchange Modules**
   - Allows users to stake GPRF tokens for bonus multipliers.
   - Enables token swaps (ETH, USDT ⇄ GPRF).

6. **Quantum Demand Currency (DCU)**
   - A 1:1 backed token pegged to GPROOF.
   - Provides a stable unit of value for users to interact with the system.
   - Can be paired with USDT or ETH for liquidity pools.

## Reputation Mechanism

- Users accumulate reputation points by consistently completing GPU tasks.
- Higher reputation results in higher GPRF rewards.
- Reputation also unlocks tier-based access to premium tasks and reward rates.

## Stabilization Strategy

- The GPROOF system includes an **auto-mint/burn protocol**.
- If price exceeds a defined threshold (+10%), new tokens are minted.
- If price drops below a defined floor (-10%), tokens are burned.
- This is done to maintain value and reduce volatility, akin to a decentralized monetary policy.

## Quantum Trade City (QTC) - Future Module

- A futuristic marketplace/dashboard.
- Includes Live Market Intelligence HUD, Quantum Swap Module, Wallet Access Panel, and Entanglement Sync.
- Visuals inspired by Tron/Star Wars with radar, holograms, and animated quantum energy meters.

## Vision

> GPROOF is more than a project — it's a movement toward a decentralized future where computing power and trust are rewarded with transparency and fairness.
