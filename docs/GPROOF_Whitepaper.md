# GPROOF Whitepaper
## GPU-Based Quantum Proof-of-Work Framework

### Abstract
GPROOF introduces a next-gen decentralized protocol that leverages GPU simulation, smart contracts, and token incentives to validate work. Unlike traditional PoW systems, GPROOF blends **browser-based GPU threads**, **node reputation**, and **quantum-inspired logic** to power a fully transparent, secure, and scalable ecosystem.

### Key Features

- **GPU Task Engine**: Uses `GPU.js` to simulate computational tasks client-side in real-time.
- **Quantum Threads Simulation**: Quantum-style waveform + entangled thread effects in visual and logic output.
- **Smart Contract Core**: Ethereum-based contracts for task submission, token rewards, staking, and reputation.
- **GPROOF Token (GPRF)**: ERC20 utility and reward token integrated with task flow.
- **Leaderboard System**: Tracks nodes based on submitted work, reputation tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Quantum).
- **Staking & Vaults**: Stake GPRF for reward boosts; unlock vaults via reputation + stake level.
- **Quantum Trade City**: Futuristic UI module with real-time market HUD, holographic charts, and entanglement monitor.

### Architecture

- **GPROOF Core**: Validates proof, updates reputation, calls RewardManager.
- **TaskManager**: Generates and tracks distributed GPU tasks.
- **RewardManager**: Mints GPRF to contributors based on their node activity.
- **GPROOF Token**: Standard ERC20 with mint control delegated to core system.
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Full HTML/JS interface with real-time GPU render, staking panel, and exchange.

### Vision

To create an open, gamified, and developer-friendly ecosystem that proves work through meaningful GPU simulation — moving away from wasted hashing towards purpose-based computation.

---

### Open Framework Potential

GPROOF’s modular design enables developers to:
- Build custom GPU tasks tied to their own logic.
- Fork the dashboard for scientific simulations, gaming, or machine learning validation.
- Plug in new smart contract modules for their own tokenomics.

### Conclusion

GPROOF is more than just a PoW alternative — it's the foundation for **quantum-era decentralized computing**. Combining science, art, and cryptography into one protocol, GPROOF represents the **rebirth of Proof-of-Work** — optimized for the Web3 world.
