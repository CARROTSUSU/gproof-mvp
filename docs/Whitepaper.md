# GPROOF: The Quantum-Powered Future of Decentralized Proof Systems

## Executive Summary
GPROOF redefines the future of decentralized computation by fusing GPU-intensive operations, quantum-inspired threading, and blockchain transparency into a revolutionary Proof-of-Work 2.0 system. It introduces a trustless, incentivized ecosystem powered by the $GPRF token, where tasks are not only distributed, but intelligently ranked, verified, and rewarded based on node reputation, quantum-scale computation, and real-time GPU workloads.

## Vision Statement
**"GPROOF is the fusion core of tomorrow's decentralized supercomputing—where reputation is proof, and GPU is power."**

In a world shifting toward decentralized intelligence, GPROOF stands as the sovereign engine of trust, performance, and value.

## Core Technologies

### 1. Quantum Threads (QThreads)
Inspired by quantum superposition and entanglement, GPROOF integrates simulated Quantum Threads in GPU computation using `GPU.js`. These threads represent dynamic, entangled states that emulate quantum behavior for advanced task rendering and visualizations.

### 2. GPU Task Fabric
A distributed task execution model where computational work is assigned to GPU-enabled nodes. Workloads are visualized in real-time, validated on-chain, and rewarded automatically.

### 3. Reputation-Led Proof Engine
Each node builds a reputation score (REP) based on historical accuracy, completion rate, and honesty. This score affects future task eligibility and reward multipliers.

### 4. ERC20 Reward Token: $GPRF
The native token of GPROOF, $GPRF, powers the ecosystem by rewarding node contributions, staking for access tiers, and enabling token swaps via the integrated DEX.

## System Architecture
- **GPROOFCore.sol** – Manages node reputation, proof submissions, and reward trigger.
- **TaskManager.sol** – Assigns, tracks, and validates GPU-based tasks.
- **RewardManager.sol** – Mints and distributes $GPRF tokens based on performance.
- **GProofToken.sol** – ERC20 compliant token contract with staking features.
- **Dashboard (Quantum HUD)** – Web-based interactive dashboard with real-time GPU rendering, staking panels, exchange, and leaderboard.
